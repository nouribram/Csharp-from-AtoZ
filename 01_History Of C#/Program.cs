/**
History of C#
*/

/**
 C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language
 developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET initiative.

 It was designed to be simple, powerful, type-safe, and component-oriented,
 combining the best ideas from C++, Java, and other languages.
*/

/**
 1. Origins of C#
*/

/**
 - C# was created in the late 1990s by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft.
 - It was developed as part of the .NET Framework project, originally known as "Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS)."
 - The language was officially announced in 2000 alongside .NET Framework 1.0.
 
 The goal was to build a language that:
 - Works seamlessly with the .NET runtime (Common Language Runtime - CLR)
 - Supports modern software engineering practices
 - Provides simplicity and safety compared to C++
*/

/**
 2. C# 1.0 (2002)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Framework 1.0.
 
 Key features:
 - Classes, structs, interfaces, and enums
 - Exception handling
 - Properties and events
 - Delegates
 - Garbage collection
 - Strong type safety

 This version established C# as a direct competitor to Java.
*/

/**
 3. C# 2.0 (2005)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Framework 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005.
 
 Major features:
 - Generics (List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>)
 - Nullable types
 - Anonymous methods
 - Iterators (yield keyword)
 - Partial classes

 These features made C# more powerful and flexible for enterprise development.
*/

/**
 4. C# 3.0 (2007)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Framework 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008.
 
 Major features:
 - LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
 - Lambda expressions
 - Anonymous types
 - Extension methods
 - Implicitly typed variables (var)

 LINQ was revolutionary — it allowed querying collections like databases.
*/

/**
 5. C# 4.0 (2010)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Framework 4.0.
 
 Key features:
 - Dynamic type (dynamic keyword)
 - Named and optional parameters
 - COM interoperability improvements

 It introduced flexibility for dynamic and scripting-style programming.
*/

/**
 6. C# 5.0 (2012)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Framework 4.5.
 
 Key features:
 - async and await for asynchronous programming

 This made asynchronous code much easier to write and read.
*/

/**
 7. C# 6.0 (2015)
*/

/**
 Released with Visual Studio 2015 and Roslyn compiler.

 Key features:
 - String interpolation ($"Hello {name}")
 - Expression-bodied members
 - Null-conditional operator (?.)
 - Using static directive

 The new Roslyn compiler made C# open-source and compiler-as-a-service.
*/

/**
 8. C# 7.x (2017–2018)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Core 2.x and Visual Studio 2017.

 Major additions:
 - Tuples
 - Pattern matching
 - Out variables
 - Local functions
 - Ref returns and locals
 - Discards (_)

 These updates focused on performance and productivity.
*/

/**
 9. C# 8.0 (2019)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET Core 3.0.

 Key features:
 - Nullable reference types
 - Async streams
 - Range and index operators
 - Switch expressions
 - Default interface methods

 Nullable reference types improved null safety across the language.
*/

/**
 10. C# 9.0 (2020)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET 5 (the unified .NET platform).

 Major features:
 - Record types (for immutability)
 - Init-only setters
 - Top-level statements
 - Pattern matching enhancements
 - Target-typed new expressions

 These changes made C# more concise and functional in style.
*/

/**
 11. C# 10.0 (2021)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET 6.

 Key features:
 - Global using directives
 - File-scoped namespaces
 - Record structs
 - Constant interpolated strings

 This version focused on reducing boilerplate code.
*/

/**
 12. C# 11.0 (2022)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET 7.

 Major features:
 - Generic math support
 - Raw string literals ("""multi-line""")
 - Required members
 - List patterns
 - UTF-8 string literals

 These improvements made C# even more expressive and modern.
*/

/**
 13. C# 12.0 (2023)
*/

/**
 Released with .NET 8.

 Key features:
 - Primary constructors for all types
 - Collection expressions ([.. list])
 - Inline arrays
 - Default lambda parameters

 C# 12 continued the evolution toward simplicity and consistency.
*/

/**
 14. The Future of C#
*/

/**
 C# continues to evolve with each .NET release.

 The focus areas include:
 - Better performance
 - Simpler syntax
 - Enhanced pattern matching
 - More functional-style constructs
 - Improved AI and cloud integration capabilities
*/

/**
 15. Summary
*/

/**
 C# has grown from a simple object-oriented language
 into one of the most powerful and modern programming languages in the world.

 It supports multiple paradigms:
 - Object-Oriented
 - Functional
 - Asynchronous
 - Declarative (via LINQ)

 Today, C# powers everything from web apps (ASP.NET Core)
 to mobile apps (MAUI, Xamarin), cloud services (Azure), games (Unity),
 and AI-powered systems.

 C# remains a cornerstone of Microsoft’s development ecosystem
 and one of the most loved languages globally.
